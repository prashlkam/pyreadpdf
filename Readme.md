  Note:
  -------
  A folder called 'data' containing some pdf books is provided. Typically you'll need to empty this folder and put your pdf files here.
  When the program prompts for the file path - give './data/' or '.\\data\\' (without the quotes) as the case may be. This is the relative path to the 'data' folder.
  Alternatively you can provide any other path as well. Just ensure that the path actually exists, and it is terminated by either a '/' or a '\\' charecters as the case may be. Ideally give the full path in order to avoid any mistakes.
